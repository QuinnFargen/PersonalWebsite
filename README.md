# PersonalWebsite

quinnfargen.com files and code.

This will be the files I will use to create my personal website / resume on quinnfargen.com.
Not going to be a very complex, but a website that will have my contact, resume, and projects.
Basically a list of my projects with links to linkedin and github.

I got the theme for the website from the link below and then modified to my liking:
